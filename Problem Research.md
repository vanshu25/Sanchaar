# Problem Research

Sign Language is a communication language just like any other language which is used among deaf community. This dataset is a complete set of gestures which are used in sign language and can be used by other normal people for better understanding of the sign language gestures.
We can often see sign language interpreters at press conferences or other public address scenarios, standing on stage and conveying speakersâ€™ messages using hand gestures and body movements. But sign language has no such formal presence in the hectic environment of contemporary video conferencing, where the platforms generally use audio cues to spotlight the person speaking at a given moment
We researched about the problem that specially abled people face and looked for datasets in order to get accurate results. Finally narrowed it down to using ASL.
Planned on making an extension to be used on Microsoft Teams that could be enabled for these people that acts as a translator.
