# Solution Identification

* After identifying the problem, we researched a lot about how can we help those people who can't speak or hear.We looked into the work and research that has already been done on this problem. Even though many have worked in this field and research is still going on, no one exactly has implemented the idea in the way that we tried to do here.

* We realised and even got to know from such people that how much difficulty they feel in virtual meetings. We all have witnessed the rise of virtual meetings through different platforms like MS Teams, Google Meet, Zoom and many more! Just think in case of these virtual meetings whether they are a normal meeting or an interview, how does the people who can't speak tell their opinions or communicated with others. They feel left out and even if they try to communicate through chat, it doesn't come out to be interactive. 


* These people communicate through sign langauge and unfortunately not everyone understands it. So, to remove this barrier, we thought of a solution where we aim to develop a browser extension which will enable the platforms like MS teams, Zoom, etc to convert the sign langauge into live subtitles(or caption) so that the communication can take place easily!
